# Note on license
#
# There are 3 License files included in this archive.  Namely:
#  * ICU-LICENSE
#  * apache-license.txt
#  * unicode-license.txt
# But applicable license for the files in this upstream source is
# unicode-license.txt only. Thus above is correct.
# 
# Details of this background:
# 
# The cldr data are available as web page under:
#     http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/trunk/
# The published ZIP archives are available under:
#     http://www.unicode.org/Public/cldr/<version>/
# 
# There are 3 different ZIP files packing 3 subdirectories with the common
# license files included at the root of the source tree.  These directories
# are:
# 
#  * common    --> core.zip      (alias: cldr-common-*.zip)    (this package)
#  * keyboards --> keyboards.zip (alias: cldr-keyboards-*.zip)
#  * tools     --> tools.zip     (alias: cldr-tools-31.0.1.zip)
# 
# The "readme.html" describes license situation of the whole 3
# subdirectories as:
# 
# > Licenses:
# > 
# > • Usage of CLDR data and software is governed by the Unicode Terms of Use, a
# >   copy of which is included as unicode-license.txt.
# > • Some CLDR tools depend on libraries in tools/java/libs/; use of these
# >   libraries is governed by separate license agreements.
# >   □ Use of the ICU libraries is subject to the ICU License, included as
# >     ICU-LICENSE.
# >   □ Use of the Guava and Xerces libraries is subject to the Apache License,
# >     included as apache-license.txt.
# 
# Please note that the following files are in the "tools" subdirectory.
#  * ICU libraries are in tools/java/com/ibm/icu
#  * the Guava and Xerces libraries are in tools/java/libs
# 
# Thus files in common and keyboards directories are simply under
# unicode-license.txt as quoted above.
